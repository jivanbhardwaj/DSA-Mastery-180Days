/*

Space complexity = Auxiliary Space + Input Space

Auxiliary Space: Extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm or Space use by code.
Input Space: Space taken by the inputs to the algorithm.

Note- But while calculating space complexity, we usually consider the auxiliary space and ignore the input space.
