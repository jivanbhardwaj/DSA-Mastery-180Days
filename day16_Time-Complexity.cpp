Time Complexity

Time complexity is a computational complexity that describes the rate of change of input size to the time taken by an algorithm.


Common time complexities (Big O notation):
1. O(1) - Constant time
2. O(log n) - Logarithmic time
3. O(n) - Linear time
4. O(n log n) - Linearithmic time
5. O(n^2) - Quadratic time
6. O(2^n) - Exponential time
7. O(n!) - Factorial time

Understanding time complexity is crucial for writing efficient algorithms and optimizing code performance.

But there are mainly three time complexities to consider:
1. Best Case (Omega)
2. Average Case(Theta)
3. Worst Case (Big O)
